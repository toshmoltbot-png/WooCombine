## 🐛 BUGS FOUND

### 1. **CRITICAL: Duplicate Auto-Generated Player Numbers**
- **Location:** Player creation (manual add)
- **Steps:** Add multiple players manually without specifying player numbers
- **Expected:** Each player gets a unique auto-generated number
- **Actual:** Both players received #9001 (same number)
- **Impact:** Cannot reliably use player numbers in Live Entry when duplicates exist
- **Severity:** High

### 2. **Verification Email Goes to Spam**
- **Location:** Email verification flow
- **Issue:** Firebase verification emails from `noreply@woo-combine.firebaseapp.com` land in Gmail spam
- **Impact:** Users may not find verification email, think signup failed
- **Possible fixes:** 
  - Configure custom email domain
  - Add SPF/DKIM records
  - Consider using a transactional email service (SendGrid, Postmark)
- **Severity:** Medium

## 🔧 UX IMPROVEMENTS

### Signup/Onboarding
1. **Email verification page** - Consider adding a "Check spam folder" warning more prominently at the top
2. **Progress indicator** - The 5-step onboarding progress bar is great, but step indicators could be more descriptive (e.g., "Drills" instead of just "2")

### Player Management
3. **Manual add modal** - After adding a player, modal could stay open with cleared fields for rapid multi-player entry (instead of closing)
4. **Player list** - Show player numbers more prominently; consider making them editable inline
5. **Bulk actions** - Would be useful to have bulk delete/edit for player management

### Live Entry
6. **Rapid Entry mode** - Great feature! The tip tooltip could auto-dismiss after being shown once per session
7. **"Drill Complete" prompt** - Good UX! The "Open Review" / "Dismiss" choice is helpful
8. **Drill tabs** - Keyboard shortcuts (←/→) for drill switching is excellent. Could show this tip once then dismiss permanently

### Team Formation
9. **Snake Draft description** - Clear and informative. Good job on method descriptions
10. **Team names** - Editable team names is great. Consider allowing emoji in team names for fun
11. **Balance visualization** - The "Well Balanced" indicator is helpful. Could show actual score differential

## ✅ THINGS WORKING WELL

1. **Overall flow** - Smooth progression from signup to draft creation
2. **Build SHA tracking** - Console logs show build SHA for debugging
3. **Loading states** - Fixed infinite loading issue (build 73c0feb)
4. **Live Entry** - Fast, intuitive score entry with multiple modes
5. **Team Formation** - Multiple methods available (Round Robin, Snake, Category Balance, Ranked Split)
6. **Role-based access** - QR codes for Coach vs Viewer access is smart
7. **Export options** - CSV export available at key points
8. **Mobile considerations** - "Tap to expand" shows mobile-first thinking

## 💡 ENHANCEMENT IDEAS (DISCUSS)

### High Priority
1. **Fix auto-numbering bug** - Generate truly unique player numbers
2. **Email deliverability** - Fix spam issue or add workaround messaging

### Medium Priority
3. **Add more players for draft testing** - With only 2 players, hard to really test snake draft fairness
4. **Draft preview/simulation** - Show draft order preview before committing
5. **Save/load team configurations** - Allow saving drafts for later review

### Low Priority / Future
6. **Team trading interface** - After draft, allow coaches to propose trades
7. **Draft history log** - Show who was picked when (for snake draft)
8. **Undo team formation** - Single undo for regenerate, multi-undo for individual moves
