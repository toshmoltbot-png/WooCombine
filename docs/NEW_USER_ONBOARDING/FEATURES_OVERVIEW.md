## 🆘 Common Questions

**Q: How many players can I have per event?**  
A: Tested with 100+ players. No hard limit, but recommended max is 200 per event for optimal performance.

**Q: Can I run multiple events at once?**  
A: Yes! Create separate events for different age groups, locations, or sports. Switch between them via header dropdown.

**Q: What if I make a mistake during scoring?**  
A: All scores can be edited anytime. Simply find the player and update their scores.

**Q: Can I change the drills after the event starts?**  
A: Yes, but existing scores remain. New drills start with no scores for all players.

**Q: How do I handle players in multiple age groups?**  
A: Assign different jersey numbers or add a suffix to their name (e.g., "John Smith 12U" and "John Smith 14U").

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**  
A: Not yet, but the web app is fully mobile-responsive and works great on phones/tablets.

**Q: Can coaches edit scores?**  
A: No. Only organizers can enter/edit scores. Coaches can view, adjust weights, and export data.

**Q: How do I prevent parents from seeing other players' scores?**  
A: Use Viewer role QR codes. Viewers see aggregated rankings but not individual drill breakdowns (unless you enable it).

**Q: Can I delete an event if I made a mistake?**  
A: Yes! Organizers can delete events through Admin Tools → Event Setup. The system uses 3-layer confirmation to prevent accidents. Deleted events are recoverable for 30 days - contact support immediately if you need recovery.

**Q: What happens to player data when I delete an event?**  
A: All player data, scores, and event settings are soft-deleted (marked as deleted, not permanently removed). During the 30-day recovery window, support can restore everything. After 30 days, data is permanently purged.
