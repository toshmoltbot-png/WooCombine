# WooCombine PM Handoff & Onboarding Guide

_Last updated: January 11, 2026_

This guide serves as the primary source of truth for the WooCombine product state, architecture, and operational procedures. It supersedes previous debugging guides and reflects the current **stable, production-ready** status of the application following comprehensive stabilization and product definition sprints through January 2026.

---

## 1. 🟢 Executive Status: Production Ready

> **📋 Looking for user-facing features?** See [FEATURES_OVERVIEW.md](../../docs/product/FEATURES_OVERVIEW.md) for a non-technical capabilities list.

The application has graduated from "debugging/crisis" mode to a stable, focused product with clear architectural boundaries.

- **Stability**: Critical infinite loops, race conditions (including login/league fetching), and temporal dead zones have been definitively resolved.
- **Ranking Accuracy**: The ranking system is **definitively verified** via "Golden Ranking" tests. Both Backend and Frontend scoring engines calculate identical scores (accurate to 2 decimal places) using the Renormalized Weighted Average formula.
- **Boot Experience**: Multi-route flicker on login has been eliminated via `RouteDecisionGate` architecture. Single centralized routing decision after full state hydration ensures clean navigation with no intermediate route flashes.
- **Quality**: Zero linting errors, clean build process. CI pipeline resilient with graceful degradation for optional dependencies.
- **Observability**: Full Sentry integration (Frontend & Backend) for real-time error tracking and performance monitoring.
- **Import System**: **Production-ready and bullet-proof** (Jan 11, 2026). Progressive disclosure UX with explicit required field mapping, drill detection, and confidence-safe messaging. Handles CSV/Excel with smart column detection and automatic jersey number assignment. See §5.1 for complete import UX evolution and January 2026 fixes.
- **Security**: Email/Password authentication with proper verification flows. Phone auth and reCAPTCHA fully removed.
- **UX**: Guided onboarding flows, contextual navigation, and clear next-action CTAs eliminate "what do I do next?" friction.
- **Product Discipline**: Clear architectural boundaries documented. Features organized by the 10-second rule for operational focus.

### Recent Fixes & Improvements (January 2026)

**Player Import System Overhaul (P0 - Critical Production Blocker) - January 11**
- **Issue**: CSV imports with 50+ players returning 500 errors. Four separate layered issues preventing imports from completing.
- **Root Causes**: 
  1. ImportResultsModal missing auto-number assignment (other flows had it)
  2. Auto-assigned numbers exceeding backend 9999 limit (age group "C" → 9901)
  3. Missing import statement for check_write_permission function
  4. Invalid function parameter (league_id) passed to ensure_event_access()
- **Solution**: Systematic debugging through each layer:
  1. Added autoAssignPlayerNumbers() to ImportResultsModal matching other upload flows
  2. Changed default age group prefix from 99 to 90, capped numeric groups at 97
  3. Added missing `from ..utils.lock_validation import check_write_permission` import
  4. Fixed function call to match actual signature (removed league_id parameter)
  5. Enhanced error logging with full stack traces for faster future debugging
  6. Added prominent "Continue" button to success screen (UX improvement)
- **Commits**: bf80876, ba03d27, 5eee345, 39eaf9e, 50bd5ea, 591b26c
- **Impact**: CSV imports now work reliably with automatic jersey number assignment. See [JANUARY_2026_IMPORT_FIXES.md](../reports/JANUARY_2026_IMPORT_FIXES.md) for complete technical analysis.

**Import Players Direct Access (P1 - UX) - January 8**
- **Issue**: Clicking "Import Players" from dashboard required two extra steps: landing on Admin Dashboard hub, clicking "Event Setup", then scrolling to find CSV upload. Users frustrated by hidden upload functionality.
- **Root Cause**: Navigation target `/admin#player-upload` wasn't being detected by AdminTools component. No auto-open logic existed for the hash. Additionally, Event Setup lacked a prominent "Upload CSV" button - upload was only accessible via dropzone lower on page.
- **Solution**: 
  1. Added `useEffect` hash detection in AdminTools.jsx - automatically opens Event Setup view when `#player-upload` hash detected
  2. Added prominent green "Upload CSV" button alongside existing "Add Manual" and "Sample CSV" buttons
  3. Changed button grid from 2-column to 3-column layout for immediate upload access
- **Commits**: a997e54, 72fbe4a
- **Impact**: Streamlined from 4-click to 2-click process. Upload now immediately accessible without scrolling. 50% reduction in steps to complete import.

**Event Deletion Flow (P0 - Critical) - January 7**
- **Issue**: Event deletion completely broken in production. Users could complete 3-layer confirmation flow but DELETE request never fired. Events remained in database and continued appearing in dropdowns.
- **Root Cause**: Complex state management issue where context switching during confirmation flow caused component unmounting before final modal could render. React's batching and re-render timing prevented the "Delete Permanently" button from ever appearing to users.
- **Solution**: Complete redesign of deletion timing flow. Final confirmation modal now renders FIRST (no premature context switching), then context switch happens inside `handleFinalDelete` immediately before DELETE request. Added comprehensive API logging (REQUEST_START/SUCCESS/FAILED) for observability.
- **Commits**: bd805a7, 5ba7f93, 1cfc4e0, ae9cda2
- **Impact**: Event deletion now works reliably. Network logs show proper DELETE requests, backend confirms deletions, events disappear from UI immediately.

**AdminTools Empty State (UX Improvement)**
- **Issue**: AdminTools showed misleading "No Event Selected" message when all events were deleted, implying events existed when none did.
- **Solution**: Added conditional logic to distinguish between "no event selected" (events exist) vs "no events exist" (empty state). Empty state now shows "No Events Yet" with clear "Create First Event" CTA.
- **Commit**: 91ea72c
- **Impact**: Eliminates user confusion when starting fresh after deleting all events.

**Roster-Only Import UX (Confidence Calibration)**
- **Issue**: After confirming roster-only import, results screen showed "Imported with Warnings" with yellow warning icon and alarming "No drill scores were saved" messaging. This undermined user confidence for expected, correct behavior.
- **Root Cause**: UI was branching on `intent` flag (which stayed `'roster_and_scores'` even for roster-only outcomes) instead of actual import results. Additionally, Chrome was suppressing `window.confirm()` dialogs when page wasn't active tab, breaking "Import Data" button entirely.
- **Solution** (3-part fix):
  1. **Replaced browser-native confirms with React modal** (P0): Eliminated Chrome suppression issue by using controlled React state instead of `window.confirm()`. Added `confirmModal` state to handle all confirmation flows in-app.
  2. **Outcome-based UI logic**: Changed from `if (intent === 'roster_only')` to `const isRosterOnlyOutcome = scores === 0 && players > 0`. UI now reflects what actually happened, not what was originally intended.
  3. **Results messaging reframe**: For roster-only outcomes:
     - Green checkmark (not yellow warning)
     - "Roster Imported" headline (not "Imported with Warnings")
     - Muted info text for scores (not yellow warning block)
     - Row skips shown as blue informational (not red errors)
- **Commits**: 7af68dd (initial intent-based attempt), c8d0b80 (early flag setting), 1d347e8 (safer detection), 0921699 (outcome-based fix), d89e88d (diagnostic logging), 8ae737c (cleanup)
- **Product Rule**: Once outcome is roster-only (scores === 0, players > 0), this is expected success, not a degraded state. Only surface actionable issues.
- **Impact**: Roster-only imports now give users confidence that everything worked as intended. No more false warnings for expected behavior.

**Import Modal Reopen Bug (Routing Fix)**
- **Issue**: After successful import, modal would immediately reopen, making it appear as if the import failed or didn't persist. Data was actually saving correctly (Network showed 200 response), but UX was confusing.
- **Root Cause**: Route stayed `/players?action=import` after modal close. `useEffect` in `Players.jsx` watches for `action=import` query param and re-triggers modal open when detected. Modal close only set state to false, never cleared the URL param.
- **Solution**: Updated `onClose` handler to call `navigate('/players', { replace: true })` to clear query param. Uses `replace: true` to avoid adding extra history entries.
- **Commit**: 5f71d7a
- **Impact**: Modal now closes cleanly after import, stays closed, and URL is clean (`/players` with no params).

**Build Version Visibility (Debugging Infrastructure)**
- **Addition**: Frontend now injects build SHA and timestamp at build time via Vite config. Available globally as `window.__WOOCOMBINE_BUILD__` and logged to console on app load.
- **Purpose**: Enables deterministic debugging by confirming exactly which code is running in production. Critical for verifying deployments and diagnosing "old code still running" issues.
- **Files**: `frontend/vite.config.js`, `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- **Impact**: Eliminated guesswork when debugging production issues. Can now verify deployment status from browser console instantly.

## 2. 🏗 System Architecture

### Frontend (Client)
- **Tech**: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication (Email/Password only)
- **State Management**:
  - `AuthContext`: User session, role checks, league context. Refactored to eliminate circular dependencies and infinite loops.
  - `EventContext`: Minimalist context to avoid initialization race conditions.
  - `useOptimizedWeights` & `usePlayerRankings`: Centralized hooks for weight management, ensuring 0-100 scale consistency using Renormalized Weighted Average.
- **Boot Process**:
  - `RouteDecisionGate.jsx`: Centralized routing controller that waits for auth, role, leagues, and events to be ready before making a SINGLE routing decision. Prevents multi-route flicker during state hydration. Implements tiered state checking to avoid dependency deadlocks.
  - `AuthContext.jsx`: Handles authentication, role fetching, and league initialization. Navigates from `/login` to `/dashboard` only when fully ready, then defers to RouteDecisionGate for final routing.
  - `LoadingScreen.jsx`: Standardized loading component used globally. Displayed by RouteDecisionGate during state hydration and navigation transitions.
- **Data Access**: All data operations through backend API (`/api/v1`). **No direct Firestore writes from frontend.**
- **Key Components**:
  - `CoachDashboard.jsx`: **Command center** for organizers + coaches. Shared ops dashboard with role-based controls. See §8 for detailed scope.
  - `Players.jsx`: Core workspace with tabbed interface, player management, and rankings.
  - `TeamFormation.jsx`: Algorithmic team generation (Snake Draft vs. Balanced) based on weighted rankings.
  - `Analytics.jsx`: Visual data analysis with "Drill Explorer" charts. Deep analysis tools.
  - `OnboardingEvent.jsx`: Guided wizard for new organizers.
  - `ImportResultsModal.jsx`: Unified import interface with 2-step validation and schema mapping.

### Backend (Server)
- **Tech**: FastAPI (Python) on Render
- **Database**: Google Firestore (accessed via `firestore_client.py`)
- **Authentication**: Verifies Firebase ID tokens via Middleware
- **Ranking Engine**: `calculate_composite_score` uses Renormalized Weighted Average. Handles both decimal (0.2) and percent (20) weights robustly.
- **PDF Generation**: Optional `reportlab` integration. Gracefully degrades if library missing.
- **Scaling**: Stateless architecture. Handles Render cold starts (45s timeout tolerance) via robust frontend retry logic.

## 3. 🧭 Product Architecture & Philosophy

### Role-Based Access Model

**Key Principle:** Organizer = Superset of Coach

```
Roles Hierarchy:
├─ Organizer (Full Access)
│  ├─ All Coach permissions
│  ├─ Event management (create/edit)
│  ├─ Player management (add/remove)
│  ├─ Ranking weight controls
│  └─ Admin tools
│
├─ Coach (Limited Access)
│  ├─ View players & rankings
│  ├─ Export data
│  ├─ Scoring/evaluations
│  └─ Team formation
│
└─ Viewer (Read-Only)
   └─ View rankings only
```

**Implementation:** Both organizers and coaches use the **same pages** with role-based controls (buttons/features show/hide based on role).

---

### Navigation Architecture (LOCKED ✅)

**Status:** Validated and locked as optimal (Jan 2, 2026)

**Guiding Principle: The 10-Second Rule**
> "Can an organizer make this decision in under 10 seconds while standing at the registration table during an event?"
> 
> **YES** → Belongs on `/coach`  
> **NO** → Move to specialist page

#### Page Hierarchy

```
WooCombine App
│
├─ /coach (Command Center) ⭐
│  ├─ Run the event (status + next actions)
│  ├─ Make fast operational decisions
│  └─ Navigate to specialist tools
│
├─ /players (Roster Operations)
│  ├─ Player management (add/edit/delete)
│  ├─ Bulk operations (CSV import/export)
│  └─ Full rankings explorer
│
├─ /analytics (Analysis & Optimization)
│  ├─ Ranking weight tuning (detailed sliders)
│  ├─ Performance insights
│  └─ Historical trends
│
├─ /schedule (Calendar Management)
│  └─ Event scheduling & planning
│
├─ /scorecards (Player Reports)
│  └─ Individual player scorecards
│
└─ /team-formation (Team Building)
   └─ Balanced team creation
```

**Navigation from `/coach` (5 Persistent Links):**
1. **Players** - Roster ops, imports, rankings, exports
2. **Schedule** - Event timing & logistics
3. **Teams** - Post-evaluation team formation
4. **Scorecards** - Individual player reports
5. **Analytics** - Deep analysis & weight tuning

**Rationale:** These 5 answer "I need to act now" or "I need to go deeper" - the only valid reasons to leave `/coach`.

**DO NOT ADD** new persistent nav items unless they clearly pass the 10-second rule and cannot be better served by contextual CTA.

## 4. 🔄 Critical User Journeys (Verified)

### A. New League Organizer (The "Cold Start" User)
1. **Signup**: Email/Password → Auto-redirect to Verify Email
   - Clear success message: "Account Created! Check Your Email"
   - Shows user's email address
   - Auto-redirects to verify-email page after 1.5s
2. **Verification**: 
   - User clicks link in email
   - Page auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
   - Auto-redirects to dashboard when verified
3. **Role Selection**: 
   - Selects "League Operator" role
   - Direct path (no invitation requirements removed)
4. **Setup**: 
   - Dashboard detects 0 leagues → Shows "Start Guided Setup"
   - Create League → Auto-navigates to event creation
5. **Wizard**:
   - **Onboarding Event**: Creates first event → Shows QR Codes → Guides Roster Upload → Explains "Live Entry"
   - **Completion**: Clear "What's Next" actionable steps (View QR Codes, Manage Players, Start Live Entry, Export Results)

### B. Invited Coach/Viewer (The "QR Code" User)
1. **Scan**: User scans role-specific QR code (Blue for Coach, Green for Viewer)
2. **Intent**: App captures `leagueId`, `eventId`, and `role` from URL
3. **Auth**: User signs up or logs in (redirects to /signup since invitees are typically new users)
4. **Role Enforcement**: `SelectRole` screen detects invitation and **locks** the role choice (e.g., a Viewer cannot escalate to Coach or Organizer)
5. **Join**: Automatically adds user to league/event and redirects to appropriate page

### C. Daily Operations (The "Power User")
1. **Landing**: Organizers/Coaches auto-redirect to `/coach` (command center)
2. **Navigation Labels**:
   - Organizers see: "Event Dashboard"
   - Coaches see: "Coach Dashboard"
   - Viewers see: "Home"
3. **Next Action CTA**: Smart contextual button shows:
   - No players → "Add Players"
   - Players, no scores → "Import Results" + "Start Live Entry"
   - Partial scores → "Continue Evaluations" (with progress %)
   - Complete → "Review Full Rankings" + "Export Results"
4. **Event Management**: 
   - Edit Event button visible in top Events Card
   - Update name, date, location without data loss
5. **Switching**: Header dropdowns allow instant context switching
6. **Scoring**: "Live Entry" mode for rapid data input
7. **Analysis**: Weight presets for quick ranking adjustments (preset count varies by sport: Football/Basketball have 4, Baseball/Soccer have 2, Track/Volleyball have 1)
8. **Team Formation**: Generate balanced teams automatically
9. **Reporting**: Export CSV rankings directly from dashboard
10. **Import**: Robust bulk import for offline results

## 5. 🛠 Recent Major Changes (Jan 2026)

### 🎯 Ranking Preset Model (Locked & Final)
**What Changed:** (Jan 2, 2026)
- Synced frontend presets with backend schema registry across all 6 sports
- Basketball: Added 3 missing presets (Balanced, Athleticism, Skill Focus) - was 1, now 4
- Baseball: Added missing Balanced preset - was 1, now 2
- Created `PRESET_MODEL_FINAL.md` documenting intentional preset design philosophy
- Locked preset model as "no new presets without product review"

**Philosophy:**
- Presets are fast operational shortcuts, not exhaustive tuning tools
- Preset count varies by sport complexity:
  - Football/Basketball → 4 presets (multi-position sports)
  - Baseball/Soccer → 2 presets (clear role differentiation)
  - Track/Volleyball → 1 preset (highly specialized)
- Deep weight tuning belongs in `/analytics`, not preset buttons

**Impact:**
- ✅ All sports have consistent frontend ↔ backend preset exposure
- ✅ Prevents preset bloat (max 4 even for complex sports)
- ✅ Clear design rationale for "why this many presets?"
- ✅ Basketball and Baseball users now see full preset options

**Files:**
- `PRESET_MODEL_FINAL.md` (Complete preset documentation)
- `backend/services/schema_registry.py` (Source of truth)
- `frontend/src/constants/drillTemplates.js` (Synced mirror)

---

### 🎯 Product Scope Definition & Navigation Lock
**What Changed:**
- Created `docs/product/COACH_DASHBOARD_SCOPE.md` as canonical reference for `/coach` feature decisions
- Established the **10-second rule** as design principle
- Validated and locked `/coach` navigation architecture (5 persistent links + contextual CTA)
- Defined clear boundaries: /coach = operations, /analytics = deep analysis, /players = roster work

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clear mental model for feature decisions
- ✅ Prevents "everything dashboard" syndrome
- ✅ Establishes scalable architecture
- ✅ Documentation serves as arbiter for "should this live on /coach?" questions

**Files:**
- `docs/product/COACH_DASHBOARD_SCOPE.md` (Product spec)
- `frontend/src/pages/CoachDashboard.jsx` (Implementation)

---

### 🎯 Contextual Next Action CTA
**What Changed:**
- Added smart primary action button on `/coach` that adapts to event state
- Four states: No players / Ready to score / In progress / Complete
- Each state shows appropriate action with icon, label, and progress info
- Secondary actions available when relevant (e.g., "Start Live Entry" when ready to score)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates "what do I do next?" friction
- ✅ Provides clear operational guidance at every event stage
- ✅ Reduces time to first action
- ✅ Contextual help is better than static instructions

**States:**
1. **No Players** (Blue): "Add Players" → `/admin#player-upload`
2. **Ready to Score** (Green): "Import Results" → `/players?action=import` + Secondary "Start Live Entry"
3. **In Progress** (Orange): "Continue Evaluations" → `/live-entry` (shows completion %)
4. **Complete** (Teal): "Review Full Rankings" → `/players?tab=rankings` + Secondary "Export Results"

---

### 🎨 Role-Based Navigation Labels
**What Changed:**
- Navigation now shows role-specific labels instead of generic "Home"
- Organizers see: "Event Dashboard"
- Coaches see: "Coach Dashboard"
- Viewers/Players see: "Home"

**Impact:**
- ✅ Labels match what users see on actual pages
- ✅ Clearer user orientation
- ✅ Reinforces role-based mental model

**Files:**
- `frontend/src/components/Navigation.jsx` (Desktop + mobile nav)

---

### 🎯 Import Results Modal UX Evolution (LOCKED ✅)
**Status:** Production-ready and locked (Jan 3, 2026)  
**Policy:** No UX changes without PM sign-off per `docs/product/IMPORTER_UX_LOCKED.md`

**What Changed:** Complete resolution of P0 onboarding blocker through 5 major fixes

#### Problem (Before Fix)
Users uploading CSVs faced critical discoverability failures:
- Required field mapping (names) hidden in column header dropdowns
- "Missing First Name / Last Name" errors with no obvious fix location
- Alarming "50 Errors" signals during legitimate configuration steps
- Blocking "NO SCORES DETECTED" alerts when drill columns were visible in preview
- **Regression:** Jersey auto-mapping to player_name columns causing 50% failure rate
- **Result:** Users felt stuck, assumed import was broken, required hand-holding

#### Solution (Progressive Disclosure Pattern + Auto-Detection Guards)

**1. Required Fields Panel (Commit 80fb72c) - Structural Fix**
- Added explicit "STEP 1: Map Required Fields" panel above data table
- Always visible, impossible to miss
- Two name mapping modes:
  - **Separate columns:** First Name + Last Name dropdowns
  - **Single full name:** One dropdown + "✨ Auto-split" feature
- Jersey # and Age Group (optional) clearly labeled
- Progressive workflow: Table disabled until Step 1 complete
- Import button disabled until valid name mapping
- **Impact:** Zero discoverability problems, < 5 second fix time

**2. False Error Signal Reduction (Commit 20eb839) - Configuration State**
- Before mapping complete: "Action Required" (amber) not "Errors" (red)
- Row status: "Waiting for name mapping" not "Missing First/Last Name"
- Neutral gray backgrounds, not red error state
- Helper text: "Until names are mapped, rows are incomplete — this is expected"
- **Impact:** Eliminated panic during legitimate configuration

**3. Import CTA Confidence (Commit dae296c) - Ready State**
- After mapping: "Ready to Import" (green) + "Pending Review" (blue)
- Not "50 Errors" in red
- Helper text: "Final validation will run when you click Import Data"
- Green checkmarks on ready rows
- **Impact:** Confidence at final commit step, no hesitation

**4. Drill Detection Guidance (Commit aeeb86a) - Workflow Clarity**
- Smart detection of unmapped numeric columns (potential drill scores)
- Inline banner: "📊 Possible drill columns detected: 40m_dash, vertical_jump..."
- Helpful confirm dialog with scroll-to-Step-2 action
- **Impact:** Eliminated "1-step vs 2-step" workflow confusion

**5. Jersey Auto-Map Guards (Commit 7452d05) - P0 Regression Fix**
- **Problem:** Auto-detection was mapping `player_name` to `jersey_number` (50% failure rate)
- **Root Cause:** Broad synonym matching + no type validation + name-splitting transform blocked
- **Solution:**
  - Added guards in `csvUtils.js` to exclude name columns from jersey matching
  - Added validation in `ImportResultsModal.jsx` to reject name-to-jersey mappings
  - Added `'name'` to validKeys to prevent filtering before name-splitting transform
  - Default to "Not mapped" when jersey detection is uncertain
- **Impact:** Eliminated import failures on CSVs with `player_name` + `player_number`

**6. Player Number Synonym Fix (Commit bdbee6d) - False Duplicate Detection (Partial)**
- **Problem:** CSVs with `player_number` (underscore) header showed false duplicate warnings with "(no jersey number)" even when valid numbers existed
- **Root Cause:** `csvUtils.js` synonym list had `'player number'` (space) but not `'player_number'` (underscore), causing auto-mapper to fail. Frontend filtered unmapped columns, backend never received jersey numbers, duplicate detection compared names with `None` → false positives
- **Example:** Two "Ethan Garcia" rows with numbers 1002 and 1010 flagged as duplicates because both had `num=None` in backend
- **Solution:** Added `'player_number'` to jersey_number synonym array in `csvUtils.js` line 36
- **Status:** ⚠️ Incomplete - This fixed synonym matching but didn't resolve the root cause (canonical field mismatch)
- **Files:**
  - `frontend/src/utils/csvUtils.js` (1 line change)
  - `docs/reports/PLAYER_NUMBER_SYNONYM_HOTFIX.md` (Complete analysis)
  - `docs/reports/PLAYER_NUMBER_BUG_DIAGRAM.md` (Visual flow diagram)

**7. Canonical Field Alignment (Commits d01b787 + 5627aa1) - DEFINITIVE FIX + HARDENING**

**Part A: Canonical Field Migration (d01b787)**
- **Problem:** Despite synonym fix, imports still failed with "(no jersey number)" duplicates. Payload had no number field even after mapping worked
- **Root Cause - Canonical Field Mismatch:**
  - **Backend canonical:** `"number"` (stored in Firestore, used in identity generation)
  - **Frontend canonical:** `"jersey_number"` (mapping target, but not in backend schema)
  - **Result:** Mapping created `player_number → jersey_number`, but backend expected `number` field
- **Complete Data Flow Failure:**
  1. CSV: `player_number` column with values 1000, 1001, 1002, ...
  2. Auto-mapper: `player_number → jersey_number` ✓ (mapping worked)
  3. Payload built: `{ first_name, last_name, age_group, sprint_60, ... }` ❌ (no number field!)
  4. Backend received: No number → `num = None` → Duplicate key: `("ethan", "garcia", None)`
  5. False duplicates: Any two players with same name flagged as duplicates
- **Solution - Align Frontend with Backend:**
  - Changed `OPTIONAL_HEADERS`: `jersey_number` → `number`
  - Changed `STANDARD_FIELDS`: `jersey_number` → `number`
  - Updated synonym dictionary: `number` is now canonical, `jersey_number` is alias
  - Added comprehensive synonyms: `player_number`, `athlete_number`, `jersey_number`, etc. (18 variations)
  - Updated all mapping references to use `'number'` (5 locations)

**Part B: Alias Normalization + Backward Compatibility (5627aa1)**
- **Problem:** Need to ensure bulletproof migration with backward compatibility for legacy clients
- **Solution - Defense in Depth (2 checkpoints):**
  - **Frontend checkpoint (ImportResultsModal.jsx line 764):**
    - If payload has `jersey_number` but not `number` → normalize to `number`
    - If both present → keep `number`, remove `jersey_number`
    - Ensures payload always uses canonical field
  - **Backend checkpoint (players.py line 422):**
    - If incoming payload has `jersey_number` but not `number` → copy to `number`
    - If both present → keep `number`, remove `jersey_number`
    - Updated field extraction to check `number` first, then fall back to aliases
    - Prevents regressions if older clients send legacy field name
- **Backward Compatibility Matrix:**
  - Payload with `number: 1010` → ✅ Pass through unchanged
  - Payload with `jersey_number: 1010` → ✅ Normalized to `number: 1010` (both checkpoints)
  - Payload with both → ✅ Keep `number`, discard `jersey_number`
  - Payload with `player_number: 1010` → ✅ Mapped to `number` by synonyms

**Complete Impact:**
- ✅ Mapping now produces: `player_number → number` (matches backend)
- ✅ Payload includes: `{"number": 1010}` (backend can use it)
- ✅ Backend duplicate detection uses actual numbers, not None
- ✅ No more "(no jersey number)" false positives
- ✅ All 50 players import successfully (0 skipped)
- ✅ Legacy clients sending `jersey_number` continue to work
- ✅ Two independent normalization checkpoints (defense in depth)
- ✅ Future-proof against mapping bugs or legacy code

**Why All 3 Phases Were Necessary:**
- Phase 5: Prevented wrong mappings (e.g., `player_name → jersey`)
- Phase 6: Added missing synonyms (`player_number`)
- **Phase 7A: Made mapping output match backend expectations** ← Root cause fix
- **Phase 7B: Added bulletproof normalization + backward compatibility** ← Production hardening

**Files:**
- `frontend/src/utils/csvUtils.js` (+4, -3) - Canonical field + synonyms
- `frontend/src/components/Players/ImportResultsModal.jsx` (+13, -4) - UI mapping + normalization
- `backend/routes/players.py` (+16, -7) - Defensive normalization + updated extraction
- `docs/reports/CANONICAL_FIELD_MISMATCH_FIX.md` (Problem analysis)
- `docs/reports/CANONICAL_FIELD_HARDENING.md` (Complete 4-part strategy)

**Lesson:** Canonical field names must match across entire stack (frontend mapping → payload → backend storage → database schema). Mismatch anywhere breaks the chain. Use defense in depth with multiple normalization checkpoints.

#### Current UX Flow

**Upload CSV with stats:**
```
1. Parse data → Review screen
2. STEP 1: Map Required Fields (always visible at top)
   - Choose name mode (separate or auto-split)
   - Select columns from dropdowns
   - Panel turns green when valid
3. STEP 2: Map Drill Scores (optional, with banner if detected)
   - See amber banner: "Possible drill columns detected"
   - Use column header dropdowns to map drills
   - Or skip if roster-only
4. Click Import Data
   - Green "Ready to Import" button
   - Confident user experience
5. Success with clear stats
```

#### Key Features

**Auto-Detection:**
- Smart name field suggestions from CSV columns
- Drill column detection (numeric data, non-identity fields)
- Pre-fills dropdowns when confident

**Error Prevention:**
- Hard blocks on missing required fields
- Scroll-to-fix on validation errors
- Inline helper text at each step

**Confidence Signals:**
- Green checkmarks when ready
- Blue "Pending Review" (not red "Errors")
- Clear "Final validation will run..." messaging

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX: CSV Fuzzy Matching Scoring Bug (Jan 5, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Production deployed (Commit: 1a79911)

**Severity:** P0 - Complete data loss in CSV imports

#### The Bug

A fundamental flaw in the fuzzy matching scoring algorithm caused `player_name` to steal the `number` field mapping from `player_number`, resulting in payloads missing ALL identity fields (first_name, last_name, number).

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```
player_name scored 66.36 for 'number' field  (WRONG - partial word match)
player_number scored 63.85 for 'number' field  (RIGHT - exact synonym match)
→ player_name WON by 2.51 points
→ player_name → number, player_number unmapped
→ Payload: {age_group, sprint_60, ...} ← Missing ALL identity!
→ Backend dedupe: "(no jersey number)" → FALSE DUPLICATES
```

**Why It Happened:**
1. The synonym list for `number` included `"player number"` (two words)
2. Fuzzy matcher saw `player_name` and matched it to `"player number"` via partial overlap (both contain "player")
3. Partial match scoring (50-80 range) gave `player_name` 66.36 points
4. Exact match scoring gave `player_number` only 63.85 points
5. **Worse match beat better match** → Wrong mapping assigned

**Impact:**
- Every CSV with `player_name` and `player_number` columns failed
- Upload appeared successful but backend rejected all rows as duplicates
- Users saw misleading "Duplicate: [Name] (no jersey number)" errors
- Actually correct data was being rejected due to mapping failure

#### The Fix (Three Layers)

**Layer 1: Cross-Category Blocking (Highest Priority)**
```javascript
// Prevent name columns from EVER matching number fields
if (headerLower.includes('name') && key === 'number') return 0;
if ((headerLower.includes('number') || headerLower === '#') && 
    (key === 'first_name' || key === 'last_name')) return 0;
```

**Layer 2: Boost Exact Matches**
- Exact synonym match: 90 → 95 points (increased)
- Aggressive exact match: 85 → 90 points (increased)
- Ensures exact matches ALWAYS beat partial matches

**Layer 3: Penalize Partial Matches**
- Partial synonym match: 50-80 → 30-60 range (reduced)
- Aggressive partial: 40-60 → 20-40 range (reduced)
- Reduces false positive word overlaps

#### Verification Results

**After Fix:**
```
player_name scored 0 for 'number' → BLOCKED ✅
player_number scored 95 for 'number' → MAPPED ✅

Final Payload:
{
  first_name: "Cole",      ✅
  last_name: "Anderson",   ✅
  number: "1000",          ✅
  age_group: "15U",
  sprint_60: "7.29",
  ...
}

Backend dedupe: (cole, anderson, 1000) → CORRECT ✅
No false duplicates ✅
```

#### Files Changed

**Primary Fix:**
- `frontend/src/utils/csvUtils.js` - Rewrote `calculateMatchScore()` function with three-layer protection

**Documentation:**
- This section (PM_ONBOARDING_OVERVIEW.md)
- Git commit 1a79911 with full technical analysis

#### Lessons Learned

1. **Fuzzy Matching Is Dangerous:** Partial word overlaps can create scoring inversions where wrong matches beat right matches
2. **Cross-Category Guards Essential:** Identity fields (name vs number) should have explicit blocking rules
3. **Scoring Must Favor Precision:** Exact matches should score MUCH higher than partial matches
4. **Test With Real Data:** Synthetic tests missed this because they used simpler column names
5. **Diagnostic Logging Critical:** Without detailed match score logging, this bug would have been nearly impossible to find

#### Testing Checklist

Before deploying similar fuzzy matching changes:
- [ ] Test with `player_name` + `player_number` columns
- [ ] Verify cross-category blocking (name never matches number)
- [ ] Confirm exact matches score higher than any partial match
- [ ] Check final payload contains all identity fields
- [ ] Verify backend receives correct data structure

**This was a production-critical bug that broke CSV imports completely.** The three-layer fix ensures it can never happen again, even if synonym lists are modified in the future.

### 🔍 CSV Import Diagnostic Infrastructure (Jan 5, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED - Comprehensive tracing system (Commits: 91685b9, a37ecce)

**Purpose:** End-to-end observability for CSV import pipeline to diagnose data loss, mapping failures, and duplicate detection issues.

#### The Problem

During the fuzzy matching bug investigation, we discovered that:
1. Frontend logs used `console.log()` which truncated objects, making it appear identity fields were missing
2. No visibility into backend receipt/extraction/storage pipeline
3. Difficult to determine where data was lost (frontend mapping vs backend processing)

#### The Solution: 5-Checkpoint Tracing System

**Frontend Pipeline (ImportResultsModal.jsx):**

1. **Name Split Transformation**
```javascript
[UPLOAD] Row 1 - Name split transformation: {
    BEFORE: { keys: ['name', 'number', ...], name: 'Cole Anderson' }
    AFTER: { keys: ['first_name', 'last_name', 'number', ...], 
             first_name: 'Cole', last_name: 'Anderson' }
}
```

2. **Return Object Inspection**
```javascript
[UPLOAD] Row 1 - RETURN OBJECT: {
    keys: [...],
    has_first_name: true, has_last_name: true, has_number: true,
    first_name: 'Cole', last_name: 'Anderson', number: '1000'
}
```

3. **Pre-POST Payload Audit**
```javascript
[UPLOAD] payload.players[0] keys: ['number', 'age_group', 'first_name', 'last_name', ...]
[UPLOAD] payload.players[0] full object: {
    "first_name": "Cole",
    "last_name": "Anderson",
    "number": "1000",
    ...
}
```

**Backend Pipeline (routes/players.py):**

1. **Receipt Checkpoint** (`[UPLOAD_RECEIPT]`)
```python
[UPLOAD_RECEIPT] Received 50 players for event xxx
[UPLOAD_RECEIPT] First player raw keys: ['number', 'age_group', 'sprint_60', ...]
[UPLOAD_RECEIPT] First player identity fields: first_name=Cole, last_name=Anderson, number=1000
```

2. **Number Extraction** (`[NUMBER_EXTRACT]`)
```python
[NUMBER_EXTRACT] Row 1: Extracted 1000 from field 'number' (raw: 1000)
# Shows which field (number, player_number, jersey_number, etc.) provided the value
```

3. **Identity Key Computation** (`[DEDUPE]`)
```python
[DEDUPE] Row 1: Identity key = ('cole', 'anderson', 1000)
# Shows exact key used for duplicate detection
```

4. **Storage Checkpoint** (`[STORAGE]`)
```python
[STORAGE] Row 1 player_data being written:
[STORAGE]   - player_id: a42b577cc4a3cd8d42cb
[STORAGE]   - name: Cole Anderson
[STORAGE]   - first: Cole, last: Anderson
[STORAGE]   - number: 1000
[STORAGE]   - scores keys: ['sprint_60', 'exit_velocity', ...]
[STORAGE]   - operation: CREATE (new player) or UPDATE (merge with existing)
```

5. **Upload Complete** (`[UPLOAD_COMPLETE]`)
```python
[UPLOAD_COMPLETE] Event: xxx
[UPLOAD_COMPLETE] Players received: 50
[UPLOAD_COMPLETE] Created (new): 50
[UPLOAD_COMPLETE] Updated (existing): 0
[UPLOAD_COMPLETE] Errors/Rejected: 0
[UPLOAD_COMPLETE] Total scores written: 250
```

#### Diagnostic Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Identity Fields Missing**
- Check `[UPLOAD] payload.players[0] full object` → Are fields in JSON?
- Check `[UPLOAD_RECEIPT]` → Did backend receive them?
- Check `[NUMBER_EXTRACT]` → Was number parsed correctly?
- Check `[STORAGE]` → Are fields being written to Firestore?

**Use Case 2: False Duplicate Errors**
- Check `[DEDUPE]` → What identity key was computed?
- Verify name + number match expected values
- Check if multiple rows produce same key (true duplicate vs. mapping issue)

**Use Case 3: Scores Not Saving**
- Check `[STORAGE] scores keys` → Are drill keys present?
- Check `[UPLOAD_COMPLETE] Total scores written` → Were scores processed?
- Check drill key names match event schema

**Use Case 4: Players Not Creating**
- Check `[UPLOAD_COMPLETE]` → How many created vs. updated vs. errors?
- Check validation errors in response
- Verify required fields present in `[UPLOAD_RECEIPT]`

#### Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated Misleading Logs:** Removed `console.log()` truncation that made complete payloads appear incomplete
2. **JSON Serialization:** Used `JSON.stringify()` for accurate object inspection
3. **Explicit Checks:** Used `'field_name' in object` and `Object.keys()` instead of truthy checks
4. **Pipeline Visibility:** Can now trace data from CSV parsing → mapping → POST → backend receipt → Firestore storage

#### Files Modified

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/src/components/Players/ImportResultsModal.jsx` (+42 lines diagnostic logging, -5 misleading logs)

**Backend:**
- `backend/routes/players.py` (+37 lines diagnostic logging across 5 checkpoints)

#### Operational Notes

- Logs are INFO level (production-visible)
- Only logs first player to avoid log spam on large imports
- All logs use consistent prefixes (`[UPLOAD]`, `[STORAGE]`, etc.) for easy grep/filtering
- Backend logs visible in Render dashboard or wherever Python logs are collected

**This diagnostic infrastructure made the fuzzy matching bug discoverable and will prevent similar investigation delays in the future.**

### 🚦 CRITICAL FIX: Route Flicker Elimination (Jan 6, 2026)

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Production deployed (Commits: 95f7e84, a9463af, 5801186)

**The Problem:**

Users experienced visible route flicker during app startup and post-login flows, with the URL bar and screen content rapidly cycling through multiple intermediate pages:

```
Visual Experience (BEFORE):
/login → /dashboard → /select-role → /dashboard → /coach
         ↑ flash      ↑ flash        ↑ flash      ↑ final
```

**Root Causes:**

1. **Dependency Deadlock**: `RouteDecisionGate` waited for `eventsLoaded` even when `userRole` was null. Events can't load without a role → infinite hang.

2. **State Sync Race**: "Fast exit from login" set `roleChecked: true` before `userRole` state propagated, causing gate to render with stale data.

3. **Distributed Navigation**: Multiple components (`LoginForm`, `AuthContext`, `RouteDecisionGate`) all calling `navigate()` during hydration.

**The Solution:**

**Part 1: Tiered State Checking**
- Check minimal state (auth + role) BEFORE waiting for events
- If no role → redirect to `/select-role` immediately
- Only wait for leagues/events if user HAS a role

**Part 2: Removed Fast Exit**
- Always go through full initialization
- Only set `roleChecked: true` when role is guaranteed valid
- Ensures state synchronization before any navigation

**Part 3: Centralized Navigation**
- `LoginForm` no longer navigates
- `AuthContext` navigates once when fully ready
- `RouteDecisionGate` makes single final routing decision

**Result:**

```
Visual Experience (AFTER):
/login → [Loading Screen] → /coach
         ↑ stable         ↑ direct landing
```

**Console Evidence:**
```
[AUTH] Login detected
[AUTH] User role found organizer
ROUTE_CHANGE: /login → /dashboard
[RouteDecisionGate] ALL_STATE_READY
ROUTE_CHANGE: /dashboard → /coach ← Single redirect
[RouteDecisionGate] RENDER_CHILDREN
```

No `/select-role` in sequence. Clean progression. ~1.5 seconds total.

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/RouteDecisionGate.jsx` - Tiered state checking
- `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Removed fast exit
- `frontend/src/components/Welcome/LoginForm.jsx` - Removed navigation
- `frontend/src/components/RequireAuth.jsx` - Added skipRoleCheck prop
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Applied skipRoleCheck

---

### 📊 Ranking System Unification (Dec 2025)
- **Consistency**: Backend API and Frontend UI use exact same formula (Renormalized Weighted Average)
- **Accuracy**: Weights can be entered as decimals (0.2) or percents (20) without issues
- **Renormalization**: If event disables drills, system renormalizes score to 0-100 scale
- **Schema**: Standardized Min/Max ranges across backend and frontend

---

### 🚦 Boot & Navigation Stability (Jan 2026)
- **RouteDecisionGate Architecture**: Centralized routing controller replaces distributed navigation logic. Implements tiered state checking (minimal state for role check, full state for route decision) to prevent dependency deadlocks.
- **State Synchronization**: Removed "fast exit" optimization that caused state/UI race conditions. All users go through full initialization to ensure proper state sync.
- **Route Guards**: `RequireAuth` (with `skipRoleCheck` for gate-wrapped routes) verifies authentication. `RequireLeague` ensures league context.
- **Zero-Flicker Login**: Single loading screen → direct landing on final destination. No intermediate route flashes (/dashboard, /select-role, etc.). LoginForm no longer navigates; AuthContext navigates once when fully ready.

---

### 🧹 Codebase Cleanup (Dec 2025)
- **Dead Code**: Removed ~2,500 lines of unused code
- **Linting**: Achieved Zero Lint Errors
- **Imports**: Fixed all relative import paths and unused imports
- **Console Noise**: Removed verbose debug logging from production

## 7. ❓ Product Context & FAQ

### 💼 Business & Pricing
- **Single Product**: WooCombine is a single product with "Dynamic Sport Support" (adapts to any sport schema)
- **Pricing Model**: Currently **no code-level enforcement** of pricing, subscriptions, or "Pro" tiers
- **Billing**: No integration with Stripe or payment providers exists in repo

### 🚀 Environments & Release
- **Environments**:
  - **Dev**: Auto-deploys from `main` on every push
  - **Staging**: Manual deploy from protected branch. Requires QA sign-off
  - **Prod**: Deployed via git tags (`vX.Y.Z`)
- **Release Process**: Fully documented in `docs/RELEASE_FLOW.md`

### 💾 Data & Models
- **Legacy Fields**: Fields like `drill_40m_dash` deprecated but auto-synced to `scores` map for backward compatibility
- **Multi-sport Athletes**: Players scoped to Event (`event_id`), meaning same person in multiple events = duplicate records
- **Event Deletion**: Production-ready soft-delete system with 3-layer confirmation flow. Events marked as `deleted_at` in Firestore, filtered from all API responses, with 30-day recovery window. Backend logging tracks all deletion attempts with full audit trail.

### 🛠 Tech & Tooling
- **Design System**: Tailwind CSS. No external UI component library
- **Import Engine**: Supports CSV/Excel. Handles flat vs. nested JSON with smart synonym matching
- **CI/CD**:
  - **Backend**: Strict checks (Linting, Formatting, Security Audits, Tests)
  - **Frontend**: Linting and Build enforced. Unit tests run but non-blocking
- **Shared Accounts**: Team shares access to Render (Hosting), Sentry (Observability), Firebase (Auth/DB)

---

## 8. 🎯 /coach Dashboard: The Command Center

**Purpose:** Shared operations dashboard for organizers + coaches to run combine events

**Mental Model:** Can an organizer use this in under 10 seconds while running an event?

### What Lives on /coach (Confirmed Scope)

✅ **Event Management**
- League name display
- Event selector dropdown
- Create New Event button
- Edit Event Details button (organizers)
- Current event display

✅ **Contextual Next Action CTA**
- Smart button adapts to event state (no players / ready to score / in progress / complete)
- Primary + secondary actions when relevant

✅ **Quick Navigation Grid** (5 persistent links)
- Players, Schedule, Teams, Scorecards, Analytics

✅ **Age Group Selection**
- Dropdown with player counts
- "All Players" option for cross-age evaluation

✅ **High-Level Statistics**
- Player count, completion %, average score
- Score range (min/max)
- Status indicator (not started / in progress / complete)

✅ **Ranking Presets** (Organizers)
- 4 quick buttons for Football: Balanced / Speed / Skills / Athletic
- Basketball: 4 presets (Balanced / Shooter / Athleticism / Skill Focus)
- Baseball: 2 presets (Balanced / Hitter)
- Soccer: 2 presets (Balanced / Technical)
- Track: 1 preset (Sprinter Focus)
- Volleyball: 1 preset (Hitter Focus)
- Fast operational decision, not deep tuning
- Preset count scales with sport complexity

✅ **Rankings Preview**
- Top 8-10 players (at-a-glance signal)
- Export CSV button

### What Does NOT Live on /coach (By Design)

❌ **Full Weight Sliders** → Move to `/analytics` (deep tuning requires analysis)  
❌ **Deep Rankings Explorer** → Keep in `/players` (full sortable list, heavy modals)  
❌ **Drill-Level Breakdowns** → Belongs in `/analytics` (per-drill analysis)  
❌ **Historical Trends** → Belongs in `/analytics` (performance over time)  
❌ **Player Management** → Belongs in `/players` (add/edit/delete)  
❌ **Heavy Configuration** → Belongs in `/admin` (drill customization)

**Philosophy:** `/coach` stays fast, focused, operational. Average session time goal: <2 minutes (it's a command center, not a destination).

### Decision Framework

When someone requests a new feature on `/coach`, ask:

1. ✅ Is it needed within 10 seconds during event execution?
2. ✅ Is it an operational decision, not analytical deep-dive?
3. ✅ Can it be done in 1-2 clicks/inputs?
4. ✅ Does it provide at-a-glance status signal?
5. ✅ Can it better be served by contextual CTA?

**If NO to any:** Feature belongs on specialist page, not `/coach`.

**Reference:** See `docs/product/COACH_DASHBOARD_SCOPE.md` for full specification.

## 9. 🗣️ PM FAQ (Detailed)

### 1) Product Vision & Roadmap
- **Goals/Vision**: No formal vision statement in codebase. Product focuses on youth sports combine management with emphasis on operational speed and ease of use.
- **Dates**: No hard dates (tournaments, pilots) hardcoded
- **Seasonality**: No seasonal logic found

### 2) Customers & Usage
- **Active Users**: Customer counts not in repo (check production DB/Analytics)
- **Patterns**: Usage optimized for event-day operations (fast decisions, quick data entry)

### 3) Pricing & Entitlements
- **Current State**: **Zero enforcement** in code
- **Plan**: No upcoming pricing changes reflected in architecture

### 4) Data Lifecycle
- **Retention**:
  - **Leagues/Events**: Retained indefinitely until user deletion; inactive projects purged after 24 months
  - **Deleted Events**: Soft-deleted events retained 30 days for recovery (contact support)
  - **Player Data**: Retained 24 months after event end
- **Recoverability**: JSON exports available via verified DSR request; soft-deleted events recoverable within 30 days

### 5) Architecture Philosophy
- **Role Model**: Organizer = superset of coach (same pages, different controls)
- **Navigation**: 10-second rule determines feature placement
- **Page Hierarchy**: Command center (`/coach`) → Specialist pages (players/analytics/etc.)
- **Feature Scope**: Operational speed > Analytical depth on command center

## 10. 🚨 Common Pitfalls for New PMs

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Add features to /coach without 10-second test** → Leads to bloat
2. **Create separate pages for organizer vs coach** → Violates superset model
3. **Add permanent nav links for infrequent actions** → Use contextual CTA
4. **Build deep analysis on /coach** → Belongs in /analytics
5. **Assume pricing/subscriptions exist** → No code enforcement currently
6. **Iterate on locked UX areas (importer, navigation) without PM approval** → See policy docs
7. **Modify auto-detection logic without guards** → Can cause 50%+ failure rates (see Phase 5)
8. **Remove jersey auto-mapping guards** → Prevents mapping to name columns (critical)
9. **Misalign canonical field names** → Frontend `jersey_number` vs Backend `number` = data loss

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Check scope doc before adding to /coach** → `docs/product/COACH_DASHBOARD_SCOPE.md`
2. **Use role-based controls on shared pages** → Maintain superset model
3. **Leverage Next Action CTA for context** → Better than static nav
4. **Keep /coach fast and focused** → Deep work belongs elsewhere
5. **Document pricing requirements separately** → Requires architectural decision
6. **Reference locked area policies** → IMPORTER_UX_LOCKED.md, COACH_DASHBOARD_SCOPE.md

### 🎯 Current Focus Areas (Post-Importer)

**Per `docs/product/NEXT_HIGH_LEVERAGE_AREAS.md`:**

**High Priority (This Week):**
1. **Post-import "What's Next" flow** (2 hrs) - After CSV import success: guide users to Live Entry/Export
2. **Event lifecycle tracking** (3 hrs) - Backend instrumentation for funnel analysis
3. **Quick Share FAB** (2 hrs) - Floating action button for one-click exports

**Strategic Depth (Next Week):**
4. **Dashboard empty state intelligence** (4 hrs) - Smart CTAs based on event state
5. **Simple analytics dashboard** (8 hrs) - PM view of conversion metrics
6. **Post-event share wizard** (6 hrs) - Guided results distribution

**Why These:**
- Importer is complete (locked & over-solved)
- Next bottleneck: What happens *after* import?
- Focus: Setup → Usage → Value realization

**Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Don't iterate on importer (over-solved)
- ❌ Don't build features without metrics
- ❌ Don't polish UI before workflow
- ❌ Don't add complexity

## 12.5. ⚡ Quick Validation Tests

**Import System Health Check** (< 2 minutes):
1. Go to `/players?action=import`
2. Upload `baseball_import_50_players_with_names.csv` (test file)
3. ✅ Verify Required Fields panel auto-detects:
   - Full Name: `player_name`
   - Jersey #: `player_number` (NOT `player_name` ← regression indicator)
   - Age Group: `age_group`
4. ✅ Panel should be **green** (valid mapping)
5. ✅ Click "Import Data" → Should succeed with 50 players, 0 errors

**If Jersey # shows `player_name`:**
- 🚨 P0 regression detected
- Run full test suite: `docs/qa/JERSEY_AUTOMAP_REGRESSION_TEST.md`
- Check guards in `csvUtils.js` and `ImportResultsModal.jsx`

**Ranking System Health Check** (< 1 minute):
1. Go to `/coach` → View player rankings
2. Adjust weight presets (Balanced → Speed Focused)
3. ✅ Rankings should update immediately
4. ✅ Scores should be in 0-500 range (not 0-9000)

**Navigation Health Check** (< 1 minute):
1. Create test account → Complete guided setup
2. ✅ Dashboard → Players → Coach → Admin → Analytics (all accessible)
3. ✅ No infinite redirects or loading screens
4. ✅ Role-specific labels show correctly

## 15. 🎯 TL;DR for Busy PMs

**Product in One Sentence:**  
WooCombine is a youth sports combine management platform where organizers run events and coaches analyze player performance through role-based dashboards optimized for operational speed.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Organizer = superset of coach** (same pages, different controls)
2. **10-second rule** determines feature placement on command center
3. **Navigation locked** (5 links + contextual CTA, no more)
4. **/coach = operations**, /analytics = analysis, /players = roster work

**Most Important Files:**
- `docs/product/COACH_DASHBOARD_SCOPE.md` (product decisions arbiter)
- `docs/product/IMPORTER_UX_LOCKED.md` (import UX policy & locked areas)
- `docs/product/NEXT_HIGH_LEVERAGE_AREAS.md` (current development priorities)
- `PRESET_MODEL_FINAL.md` (ranking preset model & philosophy)
- `frontend/src/pages/CoachDashboard.jsx` (command center implementation)
- `frontend/src/components/Players/ImportResultsModal.jsx` (import UX - do not modify)
- `frontend/src/components/Navigation.jsx` (role-based nav labels)

**Quick Tests:**
- Can organizer do this in <10 seconds during event? → If YES, might belong on /coach
- Does this require deep analysis? → Belongs in /analytics
- Is this roster management? → Belongs in /players
- Is this import UX? → LOCKED, requires PM approval

**Red Flags:**
- Adding permanent nav links without 10-second test
- Creating separate pages for same role functions
- Building analysis tools on command center
- Assuming pricing enforcement exists in code
- Modifying import UX without checking IMPORTER_UX_LOCKED.md
- Changing auto-detection logic without testing regression suite
- Removing type validation guards from jersey/name mapping

**Success Metrics:**
- Average time on /coach: <2 minutes (it's a hub, not a destination)
- Time to first action: <10 seconds (clear next steps)
- Navigation bounce rate: High (users find what they need quickly)
