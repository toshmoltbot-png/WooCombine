### ✅ Test 11: Deletion Target Integrity (CRITICAL)

**Objective:** Verify deletion target remains immutable through context switches

**Background:** This test verifies the P0 correctness fix that prevents deletion target drift.
When user initiates delete on Event A, the system must ALWAYS delete Event A, even if
context switches to Event B during the flow.

#### Test 11.1: Target Remains Correct After Context Switch

**Setup:**
- [ ] Have at least 2 events: "Event A" and "Event B"
- [ ] Select "Event A" as currently active event
- [ ] Confirm "Event A" is shown in header dropdown

**Test Steps:**
- [ ] Navigate to Admin Tools → Danger Zone
- [ ] Click "Delete Entire Event" for Event A
- [ ] Complete Layer 1 (Acknowledge warning)
- [ ] In Layer 2, type "Event A" exactly
- [ ] Click "Continue to Final Confirmation"

**Verification (Layer 3 Final Modal):**
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Modal shows "Event A" in event name field (NOT Event B)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Context switch banner says "switched to Event B" but deletion target is still Event A
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Modal copy clearly states deleting "Event A"
- [ ] Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- [ ] Click "Delete Permanently"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** DELETE request URL contains Event A's ID (not Event B's ID)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Request header `X-Delete-Target-Event-Id` matches Event A's ID
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Event A is deleted (disappears from list)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Event B remains (was NOT deleted)
- [ ] **RESULT:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail

**Backend Logs Verification (Optional but Recommended):**
- [ ] Check backend logs for deletion request
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Logs show both:
  - `route_event_id`: Event A's ID
  - `declared_target_id`: Event A's ID
  - `Target Match: True`
- [ ] **RESULT:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail

#### Test 11.2: Client-Side Safety Assertion Blocks Active Context Deletion

**Test Steps:**
- [ ] Use browser console to simulate race condition:
  ```javascript
  // Manually trigger handleFinalDelete while selectedEvent still equals targetEvent
  // This simulates the bug we fixed
  ```
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Error toast: "Safety check failed: You must be out of the event"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Console shows `[DELETE_FLOW_SAFETY_FAILURE]` error
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Deletion does NOT execute
- [ ] **RESULT:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail

#### Test 11.3: Server-Side Validation Blocks Mismatched Targets

**Test Steps (Requires API Testing Tool):**
- [ ] Use Postman/cURL to send DELETE request:
  ```bash
  DELETE /api/leagues/{league_id}/events/{event_A_id}
  Headers:
    X-Delete-Target-Event-Id: {event_B_id}  # Intentional mismatch
  ```
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Response: 400 Bad Request
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Error message: "Deletion target mismatch"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Backend logs show audit error
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Neither event is deleted
- [ ] **RESULT:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail
